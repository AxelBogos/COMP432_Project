## Structure
The notebooks assume directories "data" and "models" exist in the same root directory. Unless otherwise mentioned, models are saved in the eponymous directory. Notebooks are organized in the following manner:
* Pre-processing&Baselines.ipynb : This notebook contains initial data exploration, data pre-processing, saves the processed data and trains a Naive Gauss baseline model. 

* TFID_RanForest-XGB.ipynb : This notebook reads the processed data, vectorizes it with on a term frequency basis with a TFID vectorizer and trains random-forest and XGBoost models on it. Hyperparameter search for these model is also done in the notebook.

* LSTM.ipynb : This notebook reads the processed data, vecotirzes it with a Word2Vec strategy and use it as an embedding layer of a bi-LSTM model. This notebook was ran on Google Collab.

* ELECTRA.ipynb : This notebooks reads the processed data, splits it in the expected format for the model and trains an ELECTRA model. This notebook was ran on Google Collab.
